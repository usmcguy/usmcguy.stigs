# Ansible Supplemental STIG Roles

This repository contains the `usmcguy.stigs` Ansible collection of Supplemental STIG Roles intended to supplement DISA STIG content and help automate system hardening tasks across supported platforms and distributions.

> [!WARNING]
> These roles (and any playbooks that apply them) can make significant system changes and may have unintended consequences if applied without review or testing.
>
> Always back up the target system before applying these roles or running associated playbooks.
>
> Always review any code downloaded from the internet before executing it in your environment.
>
> [!CAUTION]
> Use this content at your own risk. No responsibility is accepted for any damage, outage, data loss, or other harm caused by execution of this playbook.

## Purpose

- Provide an Ansible-based collection of supplemental STIG roles to supplement official DISA STIG guidance.
- Help users adapt and automate portions of their hardening workflow across different operating systems and environments.
- Serve as a starting point for review, testing, and customization rather than a drop-in guarantee of compliance.

## Before You Run It

- Review the roles and any playbooks that apply them, and review every change they make before execution.
- Test in a non-production environment first.
- Create a verified backup or snapshot of the target system before use.
- Confirm the settings match your operating system, platform, mission, and local security requirements.
- Check out the latest compliance automation tools and official guidance from DISA at [www.cyber.mil](https://www.cyber.mil)
